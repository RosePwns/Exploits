# Lexmark-CMDi

This is a modified version of a Lexmark CMDi exploit. 

## Overview

The revised version is written in python and makes minor changes to the payload. Instead of using the expr command for arithmetic, it uses $((...)) syntax for arithmetic evaluation in Bash. This syntax allows for more flexibility and doesn't require the -e option for echo to interpret special characters.
